  <H1>Catalog Manager Integration Package</H1>
  <HR>

  <P>Welcome to the integration package of Catalog Manager. This package helps you
    integrate your applications or other external systems with Catalog Manager. It provides the public Web service interface of
    Catalog Manager as well as additional resources, templates, samples, utilities, and documentation.</P>
  <H2>Package Content</H2>
  <P>This package contains the following items:</P>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Public Web service interface</b>. Catalog Manager exposes its basic functionality at a public Web service
      interface which consists of the so-called platform services. Applications and external systems that are integrated
      with Catalog Manager invoke the functionality of the platform services. The services are accessed by SOAP messages over
      HTTP/HTTPS.

  <H2>Best Practices for Implementing Web Services</H2>
  <P>Consider the following when implementing Web services for integrating applications or external systems with
    Catalog Manager:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Web services based on Java</b>:
      <p>It is recommended to use the JAX-WS framework for implementing a Web service. The interfaces for all Web
        services are shipped in .jar files in this package. For calls from Catalog Manager to your Web service (outbound calls),
        you can directly write your Java code and include the appropriate Catalog Manager .jar file. For calls from your Web
        service to Catalog Manager (inbound calls), you implement the relevant Catalog Manager interfaces. No code generation is required.</p></li>
    <li><b>Web services NOT based on Java</b>:
      <p>In this case, the Web services MUST conform to the WSDL and XSD files provided in this package. Depending
        on the platform and the Web services framework you are using, code generation is required or dynamic usage is
        possible.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Refer to the <i>Developer's Guide</i> for further information.
