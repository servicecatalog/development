REPORTDESCRIPTION=Subscription price\:<ul><li>The first value represents the base price defined by the supplier.</li><li>The second value is the calculated usage factor, i.e. the calculation period divided by the billing period.</li><li>The third value is the product of the first two values.</li></ul><p>If stepped prices have been defined, the price displayed in the first row is an artificial value calculated based on the resulting costs. As to the user price, the second value additionally consists of the number of users. This number is the calculated average of actual subscription assignments.<p>For parameters, the selected value may be billing-relevant. This is represented by the value factor. For numeric parameters, the value factor is the parameter value. For boolean parameters, it is either 1 or 0. Parameters of type String or Enumeration have 1 as default value factor. The value factor is an additional factor per parameter that will be multiplied with the subscription and user price.<p>Role-specific base costs are not displayed separately, but included in the resulting user prices.
