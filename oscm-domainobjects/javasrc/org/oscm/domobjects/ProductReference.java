/**
 * Considering a subscription, it is possible that a user wants to migrate from
 * the used product to another marketing product (e.g. allowing more users). The
 * basic information on which products are compatible one to another is a many
 * to many relation of the type Product to itself. The default JPA managed
 * approach creates a join table, but does not take care of historization of the
 * objects. But historization is essential for our purposes, so this entity is
 * explicitly modelling the mentioned many to many relation. There is another
 * advantage in doing so: we can enhance the relation by additional information
 * in the future.
