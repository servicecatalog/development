 *         Custom similarity implementation to adjust the scoring formula used
 *         by Lucene for our full text search implementation. The basic
 *         requirement for the ranking of returned documents is defined only by
 *         the weight of the searchable fields, i.e. their boost factors. The
 *         frequency of the search term within a document, the rareness of a
 *         search term compared to all documents or the number of words that
 *         make up the field do not have an impact on the ranking though. For
 *         more details on the underlying formula of the score calculation, see
 *         org/apache/lucene/search/similar/package-summary.html.
