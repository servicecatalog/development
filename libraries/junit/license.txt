 Trademarks


 COMPANY is generally unable to evaluate the merits of trademark disputes
 because trademark rights may be based on registration or common law use,
 exist only for certain categories of goods or services and may differ
 internationally. Therefore, COMPANY encourages you to resolve trademark
 disputes directly rather than utilize COMPANY as an intermediary.
