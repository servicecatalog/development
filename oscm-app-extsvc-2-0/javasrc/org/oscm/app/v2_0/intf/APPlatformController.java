/**
 * Interface abstracting the access to an application which is to be integrated
 * with the platform's subscription management. For each application, a specific
 * implementation of the methods defined here is required. Such an
 * implementation is referred to as a service controller.
 * <p>
 * It is recommended to divide long-running provisioning operations into several
 * steps using the polling feature of APP. For example, when creating an
 * application instance, the controller could immediately return the instance
 * ID, report the instance status as "not ready", and request APP to poll the
 * status at regular intervals. Only after the instance has actually been set up
 * at the application side, the controller would report its status as "ready"
 * upon the next polling by APP.
 * <p>
 * The polling feature can be used with every provisioning operation (methods
 * which return an <code>InstanceStatus</code> object or an extension thereof).
 * The polling as such takes place by means of the
 * <code>getInstanceStatus</code> and <code>getPublicIp</code> methods. These
 * are called at regular intervals by APP to obtain the instance status and IP
 * address.
 * <p>
 * Polling by APP should be switched off for processing steps which actively
 * report their completion via the APP notification handler. The controller is
 * responsible for providing the correct URL of the handler in this case. The
 * URL has the following format:<br>
 * <code><i>base_url</i>?sid=<i>instance_id</i>&cid=<i>controller_id</i>[&<i>options</i>]</code>
 * <br>
 * <code><i>base_url</i></code> is the basic URL of the APP notification handler
 * as provided by the <code>getEventServiceUrl</code> method of
 * <code>APPlatformService</code>.<br>
 * <code><i>instance_id</i></code> is the ID of the relevant application
 * instance.<br>
 * <code><i>controller_id</i></code> is the ID of the service controller.<br>
 * <code><i>options</i></code> are optional commands or parameters to be passed
 * to the controller.<br>
 * Example:<br>
 * <code>127.0.0.1:8080/oscm-app/notify?sid=vm2041&cid=ess.vmware&command=finish</code>
 * <p>
 * In addition to provisioning operations for subscriptions, a service
 * controller can execute service operations. Service operations access the
 * resources of an application and perform administrative tasks without actually
 * opening the application.
